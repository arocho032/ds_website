      <h1>Aim</h1>
      <p class="lead">Road accidents are an enormous public health concern both in the US and abroad</p>
      <p>
        Traffic injuries have an immense financial and human cost: according to the CDC, in the U.S., they are the leading cause of death for people under 
        54 (CDC, 2020). Each year, millions of people — both driver and pedestrians — lose their lives due to crash injuries. On top of this human cost, traffic 
        injuries also account for billion dollar losses, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where the death rate due to accidents is over three 
        times higher than high-income countries (CDC, 2020). It is estimated that in the 15 years between 2015 and 2030, traffic accidents will cost the world 
        1.8 trillion dollars (about 120 billion annually; CDC, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the huge human and material consequences of traffic injuries, it is imperative that governments and private citizens find ways to improve safety. 
        Road safety data can give insight into potential solutions. Analyzing what combination of factors most contribute to the most severe and most frequent 
        accidents can aid in identifying current problem areas in vehicular traffic. Governments and traffic safety agencies can use this information to 
        implement optimal solutions within their limited resources — giving guidelines on how to increase vehicular safety, traffic congestion, and road 
        network layout and expansions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This project analyzes traffic accident data with the aim of finding which factors contribute to traffic accidents. It does so through three questions, 
        each of which is tackled in its own section below:
        <ul>

          <li><strong><a href="#Q2">Question 2:</a></strong> Can the severity of accidents be predicted? (Aurelien M.)</li>
          <li><strong><a href="#Q3">Question 3:</a></strong> What factors lead to safer driving and how can we improve driver safety? (Yassir W.)</li>

          Cars drive on roads, so a good place to start looking at possible factors affecting traffic injuries is road networks.
          Measuring the effect ofroad network changes on accident rates requires two overall steps:
        </p>
        <p>   
          <ul>
            <li>
              Defining road network differences and finding a way to measure them. For this project, road network changes were modeled
              as symmetric area differences between the TIGER/Line Shapefiles for two consecutive years. The whole area to be investigated
              was divided into a square grid, and each grid square was given a value corresponding to the symmetric area difference between 
              the roads of the two shapefiles in question.

              Measuring correlation between road network differences and accident rate differences. The accident rate different is 
              measured by simply, for each year, counting how many accidents fall in each square is obtained, and then finding the
              difference between two consecutive years.

        <p class="lead">
          For the most part, none of the experiments showed good enough correlation to imply a linear relationship beween road network changes 
          and accident rate differences. Inspecting the graphs show a preference for changed squares to result in a reduction or
          no change in the accident rate of that same square. However, shapefiles are not the whole picture, and there’s an argument to be made 
          that a lot of the road network changes which are not clearly represented in abstract shapefiles representations have big impacts in road 
          safety (e.g., lane maintenance, repavements, traffic light changes, etc.). A further step on this project would be to find a better way of 
          measuring road network changes which steps away from the abstracted shapefiles.

        The goal of this section was to determine whether the outcome of a car accident could be predicted using the given features.
        In the dataset there is a feature called “grav” which means severity in French. This feature is categorical and is encoded to represent one of four options: 
        1) Unscathed, 2) Light injury, 3) Hospitalized wounded, or 4) Killed. To determine whether car accident severity could be predicted, a data science and machine 
        learning approach was taken under a series of experiments. The Random Forest (RF) classifier performed the best in all the experiments. Three of the experiments entailed 
        predicting car accident severity in a number of classes. 
      </p>
      <p>   
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <strong>first experiment</strong> predicted all four categories provided by the original dataset. This yielded the worst results with an overall accuracy of 61%. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>second experiment</strong> predicted three categories where two categories from the first experiment were combined, “Hospitalized wounded” and “Killed”. This gave a slight 
            improvement in overall accuracy nearing 63% but a large improvement in the precision score of the newly created combined class.  
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>third experiment</strong> further reduced the number of classes to two by combining the “Unscathed” and “Light injury” together. This made it a binary classification problem 
            predicting whether an accident was severe or not severe. This experiment gave the best result with an overall accuracy of about 81%. The results of this experiment are shown 
            in the bottom right figure below.

          <li>
            The <strong>fourth experiment</strong> attempted to improve the accuracy of the binary classification problem by addressing the unbalanced class distribution. 
            Both random under and over sampling was applied to the training set, but unfortunately, the overall accuracy did not improve.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>fifth and final experiment</strong> showcased a real-world use case of this problem. Perhaps it would be useful to know ahead of time what medical equipment to 
            bring at the site of a car accident if they knew the outcome. Only features that could be known to the 911 caller or the police officer were used to train the RF model. 
            This brought down the number of features to 22, from 32 before. With about ten less features, the overall accuracy dropped by about 8%. The precision score for the 
            severe category also dropped significantly to 38%. Surprisingly enough however, the non-severe category remained above 80% accurate which is amazing!
          </li>           
          
        </ul>



      </p> 
      <p class="lead">
        In this section, the question of whether car accident severity could be predicted was answered in a series of experiments, one building on top of the next. 
        The preprocessing steps were described along with all of the intuition as to why certain decisions were made. The best performing model gave an overall accuracy of 
        81% predicting whether or not an accident was severe. This problem has many useful applications, one of which was explored in Experiment 5. For future experiments, 
        using more sophisticated over sampling approaches like SMOTE could be beneficial. Also applying hyperparameter tuning to each of the models could probably increase 
        the accuracies by at least a few percentages.
